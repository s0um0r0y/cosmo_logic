# eYRC --- e-Yantra Robotics Competition 2023 --- Cosmo Logistic (CL). #

## INTRODUCTION ##

e-Yantra is a robotics outreach program funded by the Ministry of Education and hosted at IIT Bombay. The goal is to harness the talent of young engineers to solve problems using technology across a variety of domains such as: agriculture, manufacturing, defence, home, smart-city maintenance and service industries.

## THEME INTRODUCTION ##

The “Cosmo Logistic” theme of eYRC 2023-24 is set in a warehouse used for inter-planet logistics from a space station. A robotic arm and mobile robot collaborate to sort and prepare packages to be transported to different planets. In this theme, our team  developed an algorithm for sorting packages autonomously with the help of a robotic arm and mobile robot shown in the figure1.

We have learnt to navigate this mobile robot with the help of SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) method in a warehouse. We have detected and localised the packages placed on racks, and manipulated the robotic arm to pick them up. In stage 1 of the competition, our team  completed this theme in a simulator (Gazebo).
